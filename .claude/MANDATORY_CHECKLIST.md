# MANDATORY CHECKLIST - MUST FOLLOW EVERY TIME

## üö® STOP! READ THIS FIRST! üö®

### BEFORE ANY ACTION, I MUST:

#### 1. Establish Context (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Infrastructure Location**: Am I in REGISTRY / MODULE / DOMAIN?
  ```bash
  # Optional: Check infrastructure type
  ./.claude/scripts/detect-context.sh
  ```
- [ ] **Bounded Context**: What domain am I working in?
  - Planning ‚Üí Focus on design, architecture, event storming
  - Coding ‚Üí TDD in Rust on NixOS, event-driven patterns
  - Testing ‚Üí Coverage, verification, integration tests
  - Debugging ‚Üí Compilation errors, test failures
  - Documentation ‚Üí User guides, API docs, diagrams
- [ ] **Current Task**: What specifically am I being asked to do?

#### 2. Read Core Instructions
- [ ] I have read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` IN THIS SESSION
- [ ] I have checked `.claude/instructions/main-directives.md` for:
  - [ ] Filename conventions (NEVER UPPERCASE)
  - [ ] Date handling (NEVER generate, ALWAYS use system)
  - [ ] No proactive documentation creation

#### 3. Check Current State
```bash
# Read progress to understand current state
cat /git/thecowboyai/cim/doc/progress/progress.json
```
- [ ] I know what phase we're in (DESIGNED/PLANNED/IMPLEMENTED/etc)
- [ ] I know what's blocked
- [ ] I know the Definition of Done

#### 4. Before Creating ANY File
- [ ] Is this file ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY?
- [ ] Have I checked if it already exists?
- [ ] Is the filename lowercase_with_underscores?
- [ ] Am I creating documentation without being asked? (DON'T!)

#### 5. Before Writing Code
- [ ] Have I checked for existing modules to ASSEMBLE?
```bash
./scripts/query-modules.sh --feature <what-i-need>
```
- [ ] Am I following event-driven patterns (NO CRUD)?
- [ ] Am I using state machines where appropriate?

#### 6. Before Claiming Completion
- [ ] Does it compile? `cargo build`
- [ ] Do tests pass? `cargo test`
- [ ] Have I verified each phase of Definition of Done?
  - DESIGNED ‚Üí Design docs exist
  - PLANNED ‚Üí Implementation plan exists
  - IMPLEMENTED ‚Üí Code written
  - VERIFIED ‚Üí Code compiles
  - TESTED ‚Üí Tests pass
  - COMPLETE ‚Üí All features work
  - DONE ‚Üí Production ready

#### 7. Progress Update Rules
- [ ] Use system date: `CURRENT_DATE=$(date -I)`
- [ ] Accurate status (not wishful thinking)
- [ ] List blockers if any
- [ ] Update completion percentage realistically

## üìö CONTEXT CLARIFICATION

**Infrastructure Type** (client/leaf/cluster) ‚â† **Bounded Context** (domain focus)

- **Infrastructure Type**: Where code runs (detected by script)
- **Bounded Context**: What domain/problem space I'm working in
  - Network domain ‚Üí Focus on routing, switching, IP management
  - Storage domain ‚Üí Focus on persistence, caching, retrieval
  - Identity domain ‚Üí Focus on authentication, authorization
  - Current Activity ‚Üí Planning vs Coding vs Testing vs Debugging

**The context that matters is the Bounded Context - what should I be paying attention to?**

## üõë VIOLATIONS I KEEP MAKING üõë

1. **Creating UPPERCASE filenames** ‚Üí ALWAYS lowercase_with_underscores
2. **Creating docs proactively** ‚Üí ONLY when explicitly asked
3. **Not checking compilation** ‚Üí ALWAYS verify before claiming done
4. **Not using existing modules** ‚Üí ALWAYS check what exists first
5. **Marking incomplete work as DONE** ‚Üí Be honest about status

## üìã Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Context check
./.claude/scripts/detect-context.sh

# Find existing modules
./scripts/query-modules.sh

# Check compilation
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Get system date
CURRENT_DATE=$(date -I)

# Check what files I've created
git status
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL REMINDER ‚ö†Ô∏è

**I MUST READ THIS CHECKLIST AT THE START OF EVERY INTERACTION**

If I skip this checklist, I WILL make the same mistakes again. There is no exception to this rule.
