## Completed Tasks

### Design Phase âœ…
- [x] Create network infrastructure design document
- [x] Write user stories for all features
- [x] Design domain model (routers, switches, VLANs)
- [x] Plan event sourcing implementation
- [x] Define state machines with phantom types

### Planning Phase âœ…
- [x] Create implementation plan following .claude rules
- [x] Create test plan with TDD approach
- [x] Copy all .claude rules from parent
- [x] Set up module structure

### Implementation Phase ðŸš§
- [x] Implement value objects (RouterId, SwitchId, VlanId, etc.)
- [x] Add VLAN validation (1-4094)
- [x] Implement MAC address parsing
- [x] Add mandatory correlation/causation IDs
- [x] Create basic module structure
- [ ] Implement router state machine
- [ ] Create Cisco IOS configuration generator
- [ ] Implement switch configuration
- [ ] Add VLAN management
- [ ] Create container network integration
- [ ] Add VM network support
- [ ] Implement Nix topology generation

### Testing Phase ðŸš§
- [x] Write value object tests (8 tests)
- [x] All tests passing
- [ ] Write state machine tests
- [ ] Write configuration generator tests
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ coverage

## Metrics

- **Files Created**: 41
- **Tests Written**: 8
- **Tests Passing**: 8 (100%)
- **Test Coverage**: ~10% (value objects only)
- **Compilation Status**: âœ… Success
- **Warnings**: 11 (missing documentation)

## Current Blockers

None

## Next Steps

1. Implement router state machine with phantom types
2. Create router configuration aggregate
3. Add Cisco IOS configuration generator
4. Write tests for state transitions
5. Implement VLAN management

## Definition of Done
